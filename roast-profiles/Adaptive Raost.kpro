profile_description:PLEASE READ\v\vThis profile is designed based on Scott Rao’s concepts and recommendations on roasting, as well as my experience with the KL; and to be modified to suit your needs, while making sure important things are taken care of (like the smooth decline in ROR).\vThe default settings are set for a roast of an 80 gram batch, with ~20% DTR and an end temp of ~220°C in ~7 minutes and 20 seconds (level 3.2). I find that this is a pretty good starting point and benchmark for most specialty coffees.\v\vI recommend using this as a template, making adjustments for each specific coffee, and then saving it as a different profile. \v\v\vINSTRUCTIONS\v\vPlease edit the profile based on the following instructions.\vYou want the coffee to follow the profile as closely as possible, and from the very start.\v\v1. For a bigger batch:\v— Increase the preheat power (around 75-100W for each additional 10 grams). You can find this option in the Profile Settings. \v— Transform the RPMs of the fan profile curve to a slightly higher value. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu. \v\v2. For a smaller batch:\v— Decrease the preheat power (around 75-100W for each 10 grams reduced). You can find this option in the Profile Settings. \v— Transform the RPMs of the fan profile curve to a slightly lower value. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu. \v\v3. For a higher end temp with similar DTR:\v— Transform the temperature of the roast profile curve, by either a factor of >1 or an addition of >1. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu. \v— Increase the preheat power (around 75-100W for each 5°C). You can find this option in the Profile Settings. \v\v4. For a lower end temp with similar DTR:\v— Transform the temperature of the roast profile curve, by either a factor or <1 or an subtraction of >1. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu. \v— Decrease the preheat power (around 75-100W for each 5°C). You can find this option in the Profile Settings. \v\v5. For the same end temp with higher DTR:\v— Decrease the temperature of the last two points of the profile. Make sure they are both the same temperature, and that they are always higher than your desired end temp.\vOR\v— Move the first yellow curve point of the second to last point of the profile to a sooner time. This will also require an adjustment of the preheat power to a higher value (you can find this option in the Profile Settings), and will require more power throughout the roast. This might affect the slope of the ROR curve dramatically; if possible, prefer the first option.\v\v6. For the same end temp with lower DTR:\v— Increase the temperature of the last two points of the profile. Make sure they are both the same temperature, and that they are always higher than your desired end temp.\vOR\v— Move the first yellow curve point of the second to last point of the profile to a later time. This will also require an adjustment of the preheat power to a lower value (you can find this option in the Profile Settings), and will require less power throughout the roast. This might affect the slope of the ROR curve dramatically; if possible, prefer the first option.\v\v7. For a faster roast, with the same end temp and DTR:\v— Transform the time of the roast profile curve, by either a factor of <1 or an subtraction of >1. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu.\vUse a calculator to determine the factor for the change you want.\v— Transform the time of the fan profile curve, by the same factor or subtraction above. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu.\v— Increase the preheat power (around 50-75W for each minute less). You can find this option in the Profile Settings. \v\v8. For a slower roast, with the same end temp and DTR:\v— Transform the time of the roast profile curve, by either a factor >1 or an addition of >1. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu. \vUse a calculator to determine the factor for the change you want.\v— Transform the time of the fan profile curve, by the same factor or addition above. You can find this option in the “Tools” menu.\v— Decrease the preheat power (around 50-75W for each additional minute). You can find this option in the Profile Settings. \v\v\vTHINGS TO CONSIDER\v\v— Tasting is the best way to assess a roast. However, while you might enjoy a roast, that doesn’t mean it can’t be better.\v— Green coffee quality is incredibly important. A great roast will provide transparency, but the flavor is already there to be developed.\v— Always end a roast before the last two points of the profile. This is super important, as the roaster might end the roast unpredictably. \v— The last two points of the profile must always be set at the same temperature (Studio doesn’t allow for profiles with less than 3 points on the curve, that’s why there’s two at the end). \v— Different coffees will behave differently. Please adjust the settings (specially preheat power) so your coffee follows the profile from the start. For instance, optimal fan speed will depend on bean size and density; so testing different fan speeds is recommended to dial in roasts.\v— Differences in voltage may affect the roaster’s ability to follow the curve. If your roaster can’t follow the profile (particularly at the later stages) because it runs short of power, I recommend either trying smaller batches or decreasing fan speed. \v— Try to just make one adjustment at a time and make sure the adjustment fits your coffee. For instance, if you adjust preheat for a different batch size, make sure the coffee follows the profile from the start and doesn’t under or overshoot before making another adjustment. \v— Each adjustment has its limits. For instance, if I wanted a super light roast (below 215, let’s say) with a lot of development (over 25%, for example), more than one adjustment must be done.\v\v\vThe roast levels on this profile are adjusted to my own definitions of each description:\v\vVery light (0): 214.9\vLight (1): 216.5\vMed-light (2): 218\vMedium (3): 219.5\vMed-dark (4): 222\vDark (5): 224\vVery dark (6): 227.1\v\vFeel free to edit these to suit your own definitions. You can find this as the last option in the Profile Settings. \v\v\vI hope you enjoy the profile!\vB.
